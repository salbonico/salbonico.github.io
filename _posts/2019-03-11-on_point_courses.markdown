All right, so here we are, graduating from Sinatra to full blown rails. Holly cow, that was a tough transition, but with all of my friends in the Ask a Question box, I learned it. This was by far the hardest part of the curriculum so far, but I am excited to present it now that it is finished. Building this full fledged student, teacher, course enrollment portal with social login integration took so many concepts from so many different disciplines, it's mind blowing how much I've learned. And that's mostly thanks to the Flatiron. I have to say, there a definitely a few parts of the curriculum that are vague, and one in particular, I think they just forgot to teach. Active Record Query Methods, which they literally do not teach and then test incredibly aggressively on. I wasted an entire day in agony until reaching out to an Ask a Question helper who calmed me, told me that it hits everyone and showed me the answer key, so I could teach myself. Not exactly what I'm paying for here, but I made it, and I learned it, and honestly in the real world, you learn by sucking at stuff until you have to teach it to yourself over and over again. And that is exactly what happened here.

I am so so proud of how far I have come and really quite excited to learn front end to start making this all look so pretty. I can see so many creative possibilities and I feel like I'm rounding third towards home for becoming a web dev.
