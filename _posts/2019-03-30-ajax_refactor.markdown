So for portfolio project 4, we simply had to refactor our last project. I decided to just cut back to the basics in order to focus on getting just what the tests asked for. Working with AJAX is increadibly when you think about how much speed the page gains, and how much more you can do with a page. It's pretty fun to fall down a rabbit hole and read into how JS got its start and how gmail and google maps changed everything. I remember it when it happened! Being blown away by how much the internet could do! Now being on the other side, I'm still blown away.

That said, I do have a few concerns. Mainly in how bloated the web seems now adays. Chrome now routinely eats 4 to 6 gigs of RAM. Which is way way too much. With so much ad tracking, video, moving image, and other stuff, I can see why the web has continually moving towards the ideal of minimalisim. But, it really hasn't, if anything, the web is super heavy, mainly because of so much client side work. It really is an interesting time to be in. Because mobile network broadband was inconsistant and slow, a lot of process work moved to the client. But now with LTE, and chromebooks, were seeing the beginnings of a move back towards server rendering. Maybe. 

Anyway, this was a great way to showcase why AJAX and client side rendering is so popular. But also why Chrome is so bloated. I am however somewhat dissapointed with the course lab performance by FlatIron. Much of this curriculum is obviously from 2016 or earlier. And a lot of dependencies are broken. Also, what little new content was created was shoved in and resulted in some horibly broken tests. On one hand, I learned some complicated concepts quite well due to hours of head banging against the wall, on the other hand, it's increadably annoying to finally sigh and after talking with three different technical coaches, just wiping out a test in order to move on. They seem just as annoyed as I am with the state of the courses starting from sinatra and getting worse as it goes.
