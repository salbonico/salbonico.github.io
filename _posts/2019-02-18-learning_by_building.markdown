So its been a few weeks since I built the comand line interface program BeerBuddy, and the growth is increadable. The difficulty curve has definately ramped up as FlatIron took me on a worldwind tour of routing, user authentication, sinatra, SQL, Active Record, Rake, and quite a few other pieces as I finally feel like I am learning how to actually create something.

In the past I have learned a little javascript here, a little html/css there, and a lot of dev ops, but I always wondered how everything actually worked. How did users and password actually work? How did data actually get passed to the databases, and where did the logic all live? Now I know. From what I can tell, this is only the very beginning, but now I can see the path, and more exciting, I can start dreaming about what could be possible. 

In my past career (which I'll dive into in the next post), I spent a lot of time building projects, not the coding part, but all of the other peices, finance, bid management, vendors, policy, training, politics, etc. But I always felt like I could do more, if I could just build the program myself, or at least have my hands deep enough in to ensure the process. And now, i finally feel like I am getting there. This was definately tough, it was a lot of concepts all at once and when your finally on your own to create something and that first error pops up, the amount of different things you have to check is staggering and honestly a bit frustrating. But man does it force learning. 

On a side note, the Learn CRM which is what I have been using mainly up to this point, finally was just not enough for me and this project forced me out of the nest. I truelly learned the bash shell/terminal, RVM, and git/github along the way to coding this entirely in my own environment using Sublime Text. That's a great feeling, being able to build your own environment and getting everything up and running.  

So what did I build to showcase my talents? One of my side gigs while I am learning is working with these amazing Leadership coaches. These coaches have a combined over 30 years in c-level positions and are increadble speakers to boot. Over the last 10 years they have moved into coaching other c-level leaders on how to lead. I was lucky enough to join them quite a few years ago by helping out with basic email and computer issues. While they insist in paying me actual money, the real compensation is in getting a little bit of coaching of my own, which is one of the reasons I'm here.

What they could definately use is a course tracking system, something that allows them to track what they are teaching, along with what other coaches in their group are teaching. This way they can have a listing not only for their own knowledge but if they see something cool another coach is doing, they can learn or help out!

It's basically is basic CRM, User authentication, courses associated to users, only the user that built it can edit, delete it. The whole nine yards. While it's basic now....it sure could grow...

Until next time,
