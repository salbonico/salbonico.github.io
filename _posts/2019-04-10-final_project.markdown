So the point of this final project is to create something using a Ruby API backend and a React/Redux frontend. Honestly, the hardest part here is figuring out which style to go with. React's own style is understated and plays nice with any other presentational components I may find, whereas material design is super opinionated about how things should look but if you use it, it has literally everything you could ask for component wise. There's of course a few others like Microsoft's fabric, ANT, and bootstrap. It's actually quite a fun rabbit hole to fall down into.

So I'm sticking with the online academy idea, and for this one I wanted to better track the courses from the student's perspective. I really wanted to play with the idea of using outside components and filling them in with my own API backend. This is a great challenge, but once again, FlatIron falls down on the preparation. Literally one readme and one lab for all of outside API management knowledge. And then, in order to tie it to Ruby, they just lazily linked to an outside article. What exactly am I paying for here? Luckily, Ask a Question was able to give me a bit of a hand, but mostly, it's been a lot of YouTube and Googling. Which...I don't need to pay for.. Anyways, I'll get more into the FlatIron piece of this in my last blog post.

The great part of all of this is however how flexible and component based development seems to have gotten. While some worry about the dependency apocalypse that could totally occurs, I really am loving that there's components for everything, and the frontends can play nice with traditional backends as well as new serverless cloud functions. Every piece you learn helps you understand the next piece. I'm already learning angular and firebase moving forward now that I get the basic concept of modern web development.
