<p>For over ten years, I ran all of the technology for a medium sized police and fire department, but then I took a one year leave to travel Europe by backpack and America by 88' Winnebago. I came back different, so now I'm making a life pivot to coding. You only get one shot at this world, enjoy it. </p>
